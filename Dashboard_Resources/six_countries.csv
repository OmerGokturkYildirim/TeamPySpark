Jessica,Health,United States,Portsmouth,"Over twenty years ago something happened that changed my life forever, and in turn, changed many other lives, too.  At the time, I was in college studying psychology.  The summer before my senior year of college I was hit head on by a drunken driver.\r\n\r\nI spent several years in pain; suffering from severe headaches.  I had several years of physical therapy and pain management without much relief.  I was continually being prescribed painkillers and muscle relaxers for my headaches, and eventually became addicted to them.  After many years of taking these prescription drugs, my body became so toxic that I started to loose my hair. I felt hopeless.\r\n\r\nI was at the gym one day and there was a chiropractor there performing spinal screenings. I agreed to go to her office for an examination that very week.  After a very short time I started to get relief of my symptoms.\r\n\r\nBeing under chiropractic care gave me back my quality of life.  I reduced the amount of painkillers and muscle relaxers I was taking over time until I was no longer taking any;  and life started to become clear.\r\n\r\nSince being a chiropractor I have had the opportunity to help others discover health again and regain their quality of life.  I can’t think of a better way to live my life!",10000.0
