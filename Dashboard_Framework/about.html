                   <p>Microlending has been a game changing way to address international poverty, social equity, and lack of educational parity. Kiva, started in 2005 by a young couple, launched a new strategy to effect social impact through microlending: focus on the progress of the people rather than the situational poverty. This landmark mindshift catalyzed a social movement where all people, everywhere are empowered to give opportunities to the world's most oppressed individuals at an unimaginable scale -- providing loans of more than $1 Billion dollars to date in 99 countries. <br /><br /><br /></p>

                      <li>The loan goes through the underwriting and approval process.</li>
                      <li>If the loan is approved, it is posted to Kiva for lenders to support.</li>
                      <li>In the fundraising period, lenders crowd-fund the loan in increments of $25 or more.</li>
                      <li>When the fundraising is complete, the borrower uses that money according to his/her needs.
                      <li>Then borrower repays the loan to the lender(s).</li>
                      <li>The lender(s) use the returned funds to generate new loans, donate, or withdraw the money from the Kiva bank of funds.</li></ol>

                      Analysis of the Kiva lending framework led to many questions about the data that required additional research and exploration -- and interesting insights.
